# Power-BI
My power BI notes
## Intro
Bussiness Interligence  relates to the set of technologies and techniques that collect and categorize an organization's data and present meaningful information in a format that helps make better decisions. The BI applications allow the developers to collect vast amount of data from diverse sources, transform the data according to the business requirements, and present it in a visual format like tables and charts. BI does not make decisions for an enterprise, but eases the analysis of data to arrive at actionable results.
